# Multi-Channel Retailing Optimization

**Optimizing Profitability of Online Order Fulfillment using Non-Linear Programming**

## Overview

In the evolving retail landscape, many traditional store-based retailers are expanding into online channels. This shift is driven by the rapid growth in online retail sales. 
However, operationalizing this strategy raises concerns about profitability. 
This project focuses on optimizing online order fulfillment strategies using a mathematical model derived from the article 
"[Solving the energy-efficient Robotic Mixed-Model Assembly Line balancing problem using a Memory-Based Cuckoo Search Algorithm](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0377221718306696?via%3Dihub)." 
The project implements a non-linear programming approach in LINGO to evaluate the profitability of various fulfillment channels.

## Problem Statement

Retailers face several trade-offs in fulfilling online orders, including cost vs. efficiency, store layout, fulfillment centers, and vendor fulfillment. 
The profitability of online order fulfillment depends on where orders are processed within a retailerâ€™s distribution network. 
Traditional cost-based approaches may lead to negative gross margins due to competitive pricing pressures.

## Objectives

1. **Model and Analyze**: Develop a framework incorporating profitability, pricing, and demand elasticity.
2. **Optimize Fulfillment**: Identify the most profitable fulfillment options across various channels using non-linear programming.
3. **Real-World Application**: Apply the model to data from a U.S. retailer to compare fulfillment strategies.

## Methodology

The project uses a non-linear programming model implemented in LINGO to optimize the fulfillment process for different channels within a retailer's distribution network. 
The model evaluates each channel (such as local stores, distribution centers, and vendors) to determine the most profitable way to fulfill online orders. 
It takes into account logistics costs, operational dynamics, and pricing decisions for each channel, ensuring that the chosen fulfillment strategy maximizes profitability.

## Results and Insights

The analysis shows how profitability affects the choice of fulfillment channels and the conversion of online demand into profitable sales, providing key managerial insights.

## How to Run the Code

1. **Prerequisites**: Install LINGO software.
2. **Run the Model**: Load the LINGO code and execute it with the provided data.
3. **Analyze Results**: Compare different fulfillment strategies across various channels.

## Conclusion

This project offers a practical approach for optimizing online order fulfillment strategies across multiple channels in multi-channel retailing, ensuring that only profitable orders are fulfilled.
